A covert channel is a channel that:


Transfers information over, within a computer system, or network that is outside of the security policy. : TRUE

Transfers information over, within a computer system, or network that is encrypted.

Transfers information via a communication path within a computer system, or network for transfer of data.

Transfers information over, within a computer system, or network that is within the security policy.

Covert channels are methods attackers can use to hide data in an undetectable protocol.
They rely on a technique called tunneling, which enables 1 protocol to transmit over the other.
Any process or a bit of data can be a covert channel.
This makes it an attractive mode of transmission for a Trojan because an attacker can use the covert channel to install a backdoor on the target machine.

Which of the following Rootkit Trojans
performs targeted attacks against various organizations
and arrives on the infected system by being downloaded and executed by the Trickler dubbed "DoubleFantasy,"
covered by TSL20110614-01 (Trojan.Win32.Micstus.A)?



Boot loader level rootkitc

GrayFish rootkit

Hardware/firmware rootkit

EquationDrug rootkit : TRUE

Explanation:

GrayFish Rootkit:

    Windows kernel rootkit
    Runs inside the Windows OS
    Provides an effective mechanism,
                hidden storage
                malicious command execution
    Remains invisible.
    Injects its malicious code
            into the boot record which handles the launching of Windows at each step.
    Implements its own Virtual File System (VFS)
            to store the stolen data
    Implements its own auxiliary information.

Hardware/Firmware Rootkit:
    Hardware/firmware rootkits use
              devices or
              platform firmware to
                  create a persistent malware image in hardware,
                      such as a hard drive,
                                system BIOS, or
                                network card.
    The rootkit hides in firmware as the users do not inspect it for code integrity.
    A firmware rootkit implies the use of creating a permanent delusion of rootkit malware.

Boot Loader Level Rootkit:  Boot loader level (bootkit) rootkits function either
                                    by replacing or modifying the
                                            legitimate bootloader with another one.
                            The boot loader level (bootkit) can activate even before the operating system starts.
                            So, the boot-loader-level (bootkit) rootkits are serious threats to security
                                    because they can help in hacking encryption keys and passwords.

EquationDrug Rootkit: EquationDrug is a dangerous computer rootkit
                                            that attacks the Windows platform.
                      It performs targeted attacks against various organizations and
                      arrives on the infected system by being downloaded & executed
                                by the Trickler dubbed "DoubleFantasy",
                                covered by TSL20110614-01 (Trojan.Win32.Micstus.A).
                       It allows a remote attacker to execute shell commands on the infected system.

Stephany is worried because in the past six weeks
she has received two and three times
the amount of e-mails that she usually receives,
and most of it is not related to her work.
What kind of problem is Stephany facing?


        External Attack

        Malware

        SPAM : TRUE

        Phishing

---------------------

A computer installed with
      port monitoring,
      file monitoring,
      network monitoring, and
      antivirus software
and connected to network only under strictly controlled conditions is known as:


            Malwarebytes

            Sandbox

            Droidsheep

            Sheep Dip    : TRUE

Explanation:
Sheep Dip:
          Sheep dipping refers to
                    the analysis of suspect files, incoming messages, etc. for malware.
          The users isolate the sheep-dipped computer from other computers on the network
                          to block any malware from entering the system.
          Before performing this process, it is important
                          to save all downloaded programs on external media such as CD-ROMs or DVDs.
          A computer used for sheep dipping should have tools such as
                port monitors, files monitors, network monitors, and one or more anti-virus programs
          for performing malware analysis of
                files, applications, incoming messages, external hardware devices (such as USB, Pen drive, etc.), and so on.

Droidsheep: DroidSheep tool is a used for session hijacking
                                on Android devices connected on common wireless network.
            It gets the session ID of active user on Wi-Fi network
                  and uses it to access the website as an authorized user.
            The droidsheep user can easily see what the authorized user is doing or seeing on the website.
            It can also hijack the social account by obtaining the session ID.

Sandbox: App sandboxing is a security mechanism
         Helps protect systems and users by limiting resources the app can access to its intended functionality on the mobile platform.
        Often, sandboxing is useful
                    in executing untested code or untrusted programs from
                              unverified third parties, suppliers, untrusted users, and untrusted websites.
        This is to enhance security by isolating an application to prevent
              intruders,
              system resources,
              malwares such as Trojans and viruses,
              and other applications
        from interacting with the protected app.

Malwarebytes: It is a tool for Windows OS that provides
                            comprehensive security that blocks malware and hackers.
              It protects you from threats
                            that traditional antivirus isn't smart enough to stop.

Which of the following terms is used to refer the technique
that uses aggressive SEO tactics such as
    keyword stuffing,
    doorway pages,
    page swapping, and
    adding unrelated keywords
to get higher search engine ranking for their malware pages?


        - Drive-by Downloads

        - Spear Phishing

        - Blackhat Search Engine Optimization (SEO) : TRUE

        - Malvertising



        Explanation:
        Drive-by Downloads:
                  The unintentional downloading of software via the Internet.
                  Here, an attacker exploits
                          flaws in browser software
                            to install malware
                              just merely by visiting a website.

        Blackhat Search Engine Optimization (SEO):
                  Blackhat SEO (also referred to as unethical SEO)
                      uses aggressive SEO tactics such as
                          keyword stuffing,
                          doorway pages,
                          page swapping, and
                          adding unrelated keywords
                     to get higher search engine ranking
                        for their malware pages.

        Malvertising: Involves embedding malware-laden advertisements
                          in legitimate online advertising channels
                              to spread malware onto the systems of unsuspecting users.

        Spear Phishing: Instead of sending thousands of emails,
                                some attackers
                                opt for “spear phishing”
                                    and use specialized social engineering content
                                              directed at a specific employee or small group of employees in a particular organization
                                                  to steal sensitive data such as financial information and trade secrets.
                            Spear phishing messages seems to be from a trusted source with an official-looking website.
                            The email also appears to be from an individual from the recipient's company, generally someone in position of authority.
                            But the message is actually sent by an attacker attempting to obtain critical information about a specific recipient and his/her organization,
                              such as login credentials,
                                      credit card details,
                                      bank account numbers,
                                      passwords,
                                      confidential documents,
                                      financial information, and
                                      trade secrets.

Which component of the malware conceals the malicious code via various techniques, thus making it hard for security mechanisms to detect or remove it?


      Payload

      Obfuscator  : TRUE

      Crypter

      Downloader

Explanation

      Downloader:
          Type of Trojan that
                downloads other malware (or) malicious code & files
                    from the Internet onto the PC or device.
          Usually, attackers install downloader
              when they first gain access to a system.

      Crypters:
          Crypter is a software that encrypts the
                          original binary code of the .exe file.
                Attackers use crypters to
                          hide viruses, spyware, keyloggers, Remote Access Trojans (RATs), among others,
                          to make them undetectable by anti-viruses.

      Obfuscator: Obfuscation means to make code harder to understand or read, generally for privacy or security purposes.
                  A tool called an obfuscator
                              converts a straightforward program into
                                        that works the same way
                                        but is much harder to understand.
                  It is a program to conceal the malicious code of malware via various techniques,
                                      thus making it hard for security mechanisms to detect or remove it.

      Payload:
              Part of the malware that performs desired activity when activated.
              The payload may be used for
                        deleting,
                        modifying files,
                        affecting the system performance,
                        opening ports,
                        changing settings, etc.
                  as part of compromising the security.


----------------------
How does an attacker perform a “social engineered clickjacking” attack?


        By mimicking legitimate institutions, such as banks, in an attempt to steal passwords and credit card

        By attaching a malicious file to an e-mail and sending the e-mail to a multiple target address

        By exploiting flaws in browser software to install malware merely by visiting a website

        By injecting malware into legitimate-looking websites to trick users by clicking them : TRUE
