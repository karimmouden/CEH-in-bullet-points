Tina downloaded and installed a 3D screensaver.
She is enjoying watching the 3D screensaver,
but whenever the screensaver gets activated,
her computer is automatically scanning the network
and sending the results to a different IP address on the network.
Identify the malware installed along with the 3D screensaver?


Trojan Horse : True

Worm :
  Computer worms are standalone malicious programs that
        replicate,
        execute,
        spread
    across network connections independently,
          without human intervention.

  Intruders design most worms to
            replicate & spread across a network,
  thus consuming available computing resources
  and in turn causing network servers, web servers, and individual computer systems
    to become overloaded and stop responding.
  However, some worms also carry a payload to damage the host system.

Virus :
  Viruses can attack a target host’s system using a variety of methods.
  They can
      - attach themselves to programs
      - transmit themselves to other programs
      by making use of specific events.
  Viruses need such events to take place
      since they cannot self-start, infect hardware, or transmit themselves using non-executable files.
  “Trigger” and “direct attack” events can cause a virus to activate and infect the target system when the
          user triggers attachments received through
                email, Web sites, malicious advertisements, flash cards, pop-ups and so on.
  The virus can then attack a system’s built-in programs, antivirus software, data files, and system startup settings among others.

Beacon :
  type of frame transmitted by access points to indicate that*
          it is working and on.
  These frames are like signals that
         can be captured by other devices in the wireless networks.

Which of the following ports does Tiny Telnet Server Trojan use?


21

20

23 : Tiny Telnet Server Port

22

Which of the following Trojans uses port number 1863 to perform attack?


XtremeRAT : port 1863

Priority

Devil

Millennium

Which of the following Trojan construction kits is used
to create user-specified Trojans
by selecting from the various options available?

Senna Spy Trojan Generator

Win32.Trojan.BAT

Trojan.Gen

DarkHorse Trojan Virus Maker : TRUE


Explanation:
Trojan.Gen:
        Trojan.Gen is a generic detection for many individual but varied Trojans
                        for which specific definitions have not been created.
        A generic detection is used because
                  it protects against many Trojans that share similar characteristics.

Senna Spy Trojan Generator:
        This is a Trojan that comes hidden in malicious programs.
        Once you install the source (carrier) program is installed,
        this Trojan attempts to gain "root" access (administrator level access) to your computer without your knowledge.

DarkHorse Trojan Virus Maker:
        Used to creates user-specified Trojans
                  by selecting from various options available.
        The Trojans created to act as
                  per the options selected while creating them.

        For e.g., if you choose the option Disable Process, the Trojan disables all processes on the target system.
        The screenshot in the slide shows a snapshot of Dark Horse Trojan Virus Maker that displays its various available options.

Win32.Trojan.BAT:
                  System-destructive trojan program.
                  Crash the system by deleting files.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Which of the following is a program that is installed without the user’s knowledge
and can bypass the standard system authentication or conventional system mechanism like
IDS, firewalls, etc. without being detected?


    Covert Channel Trojans

    Remote Access Trojans

    Backdoor Trojans      : TRUE

    Proxy Server Trojans

    Explanation:

    Remote Access Trojans:
          Provide attackers with
                  full control over the victim’s system,
          Enable attackers to
                  remotely access
                                  files,
                                  private conversations,
                                  accounting data...
          Acts as a server
          Listens on a port not supposed to be available to Internet attackers.


    Proxy Server Trojans:
          Standalone application that allows remote attackers
              to use
                victim’s computer
                      as a proxy
                          to connect to the Internet.
          Starts a hidden proxy server on
                  the infected victim’s computer.
          Attackers use it for
                anonymous Telnet, ICQ, or IRC
                    to purchase goods using stolen credit cards,...

    Backdoor Trojans:


          Program which can bypass
                - the standard system authentication
            or
               - conventional system mechanism like IDS, firewalls, etc.

          without being detected.

           In these types of breaches, hackers leverage backdoor programs
                  to access the victim’s computer or a network.
            The difference between this type of malware and other types of malware is that
                          the installation of the backdoor is performed without the user’s knowledge.

            This allows the attack to
                        perform any activity on the infected computer which can include
                                  transferring,
                                  modifying,
                                  corrupting files,
                                  installing malicious
                                  software,
                                  rebooting the machine, etc.
                         without user detection.

    Covert Channel Trojans: Covert Channel Tunneling Tool (CCTT) Trojan presents various exploitation techniques, creating arbitrary data transfer channels in the data streams authorized by a network access control system. It enables attackers to get an external server shell from within the internal network and vice-versa. It sets a TCP/UDP/HTTP CONNECT|POST channel allowing TCP data streams (SSH, SMTP, POP, etc.) between an external server and a box from within the internal network.
