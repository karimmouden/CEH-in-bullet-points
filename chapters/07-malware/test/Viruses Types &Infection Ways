Which of the following programs is usually targeted at Microsoft Office products?


Multipart virus

Stealth virus

Macro virus : TRUE

Polymorphic virus

Macro virus infects Microsoft Word or similar applications, which automatically perform a sequence of actions after triggering an application.
      Most macro viruses are written using
              macro language visual basic for applications (VBA),
      Infect templates or
      convert infected documents into template files
            while maintaining their appearance of ordinary document files.

------------------
Which of the following viruses tries to
hide from anti-virus programs
by actively altering & corrupting the
    chosen service call interruptions
when they are being run?


        Metamorphic virus

        Polymorphic virus

        Stealth virus : TRUE

        Cavity virus

Explanation:

Cavity virus:

        Some programs have
                empty spaces in them.
        Cavity Virus, also known as a "space-filler"
                    overwrites a part of the host file that is empty
                          with a constant (usually NULLs),
                              without increasing the length of the file
                                      but preserving its functionality .
        Maintaining constant file size when infecting allows it to avoid detection.
        The cavity viruses are rarely found due to
          - unavailability of hosts
          - code complexity in writing.

Polymorphic virus:

    Infects a file with
        an ENCRYPTED COPY
                of a polymorphic code
                        already decoded by a decryption module.
    Modify  their code for each replication to avoid detection.
              They accomplish this by
                        changing
                            - encryption module
                            - instruction sequence.
                  Polymorphic mechanisms use
                        random number generators in their implementation.

Metamorphic virus:
          Metamorphic viruses are programmed in such a way that they
                      rewrite themselves completely
                                each time
                                      they infect a new executable file.
                   Such viruses are
                          - sophisticated
                          - use metamorphic engines for their execution.
          Metamorphic code reprograms itself.
                   It is translated into temporary code
                                (a new variant of the same virus
                                      but with a different code),
                   and then converted back to the original code.

Stealth virus: These viruses try to
                      hide from antivirus programs by
                              actively altering & corrupting
                                        the service call interrupts while running.
               The virus code replaces
                          the requests to perform operations
                                with respect to these service call interrupts.
               These viruses state
                                false information to
                                          hide their presence from antivirus programs.
               For e.g., the stealth virus hides the operations that it modified and gives false representations.
               Thus, it takes over
                            portions of the target system and hides its virus code.

      Virus : TRUE

      Worm


      Explanation:
      Exploit Kit (crimeware):

          Used to exploit security loopholes found in software applications such as
                  Adobe Reader, Adobe Flash Player, etc.
                  by distributing malware such as
                        spyware, viruses,
                        Trojans, worms,
                        bots, backdoors,
                        buffer overflow scripts,
                        or other payloads to the target system.

      Worm: Computer worms are standalone malicious programs that
                replicate,
                execute, and
                spread across network connections
                            independently, without human intervention.

      Trojan:
            A computer trojan is a program in which the malicious or harmful code
            is contained inside apparently harmless programming
            or data in such a way that it can get control and cause damage,
            such as ruining the file allocation table on your hard disk.

      Virus:
            A computer virus is a
                   - self-replicating program
                   - produces its code by attaching copies of itself
                          to other executable codes
                   - operates without the knowledge or desire of the user.
                   - contagious => can contaminate other files;
            however, viruses can infect outside machines only with the assistance of computer users.
            Some viruses affect computers as soon as their code is executed;
            other viruses lie dormant until a pre-determined logical circumstance is met.
            Viruses infect a variety of files, such as
                  - overlay files (.OVL) and
                  - executable files (.EXE, .SYS, .COM or .BAT).
            Viruses are transmitted through file downloads, infected disk/flash drives, and as email attachments.

      infects the computer system
      but also has the ability to corrupt data on unmapped network shares.

      It can spread over the network using WMIC
      (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line)
      by capturing all credentials from the local machine using Mimikatz. : TRUE

---------------------------

Which of the following viruses infect only occasionally upon
    satisfying certain conditions
    or when the length of the file falls within a narrow range?

    Cluster viruses:
              Cluster viruses infect files without changing the file or planting additional files.
              They save the virus code to the hard drive and overwrite the pointer in the directory entry,
              directing the disk read point to the virus code instead of the actual program.

    Sparse infector viruses: (TRUE)
              To spread infection, viruses typically attempt to hide from antivirus programs.
              Sparse infector viruses infect less often and try to minimize the probability of discovery.
              Sparse infector viruses infect only occasionally upon satisfying certain conditions
              or only files whose lengths fall within a narrow range.

    Encryption viruses:
              Encryption viruses block the access to target machines
              or provide victims with limited access to the system.
              This virus uses encryption to hide from virus scanner.
              It is not possible for the virus scanner to detect the encryption virus using signatures,
              but it can detect the decrypting module.
              They penetrate the target system via
                  freeware, shareware,
                  codecs, fake advertisements,
                  torrents, email spam, and so on.

    Stealth virus:
              These viruses try to hide from antivirus programs by
              actively altering and corrupting the service call interrupts while running.
              The virus code replaces the requests to perform operations with respect to these service call interrupts.
              These viruses state false information to hide their presence from antivirus programs.
