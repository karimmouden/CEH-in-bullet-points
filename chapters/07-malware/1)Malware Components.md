                          - allows files to BUNDLE together into an .exe files
                          - use COMPRESSION to bypass Security Detection

    Downloader : - Trojan type
                        - downloads other malware from internet
                        - usually installed first when getting access to victim

    Exploit :  - Software or Malicious code
                            - Serves as Carrier for payloads to reach target
                            - Take advantage of Vulnerabilities to :
                                  - deploy Payloads
                                  - collect information & data

    Payload : - piece of Malicious code
                          - used after exploiting system
                          - executed on system to Gain Control

    Injector : - Program
                  - Injects malicious code into :
                                Vulnerable running Processes
                  - Change Execution Way
