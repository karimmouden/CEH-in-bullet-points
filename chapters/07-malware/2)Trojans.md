# Trojans :

  - malicious program
  - seems to be legitimate
  - capable of taking control of the host machine

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ## 1)  Remote Access Trojans (RAT) / Backdoor :

          - Malware
          - Type of Trojan
          - includes a BACKDOOR for administrative control over the target computer
          - Works like a Remote Desktop Access but :
                - installation is done without the user’s knowledge.

          - Hacker gains complete GUI access to the remote system
          - Acts as a server.
          - Usually has functionalities like keylogger, camera access, taking screenshots etc.
          - full bundle  :
                a- server app   installed on Target system (BACKDOOR)
                b- client  app  installed on Attacker system (C&C command & control)
                                gives attacker GUI access to victim's machine

  ### Process :
        
    1. Attacker Infects Victims computer with serverApp.exe
          => plants a Reverse Connecting Trojan

    serverApp.exe = Server Application installed on Target (BACKDOOR)
                    allows victim to establish connection to attackers machine

    2. Victim  initialize connection to the Attacker
       through Port 80 for e.g.
            =>  Attacker establishes a Reverse connection to Victim .

    3. Attacker now has complete control over Victim’s machine

        - Enable attackers to
                remotely access
                                files,
                                private conversations,
                                accounting data...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ## 2) Backdoors:
 
        - piece of software
                or
        - internal configuration

              designed to allow full remote access to a system.

        - Bypass Security & Authentication Mechanism
        - gives attacker much easier access to the system in the future.
        - Main difference between a RAT and Backdoor is that :

             - RAT has a user interface,
               the client component, which can be used by the attacker to issue commands to the server component

             - Backdoor  : - no user interface
                           - usually small programs ( < 10 kB )


        - initially, developed  or those with authorized access to get into
          applications & OS
          even when things have gone wrong. 
        - attacker installs backdoor on a system when he just have gained unauthorized access to. 

        - For e.g.,    1- Hacker Identifies vulnerabilities in a target network.
                       2- Hacker implants networkmonitor.exe backdoor in the target network,
                       3- Backdoor will be installed in a victim machine on the target network without being detected by network security mechanisms.
                       4- Once installed, networkmonitor.exe will provide uninterrupted access to the victim’s machine and target network to the attacker.
        - Features : transferring, modifying, corrupting files, installing malicious software, rebooting the machine,

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ## 3) Rootkit :

      - malicious software
      - permits a legitimate user to have confidential access to
              - a system
              - privileged areas of its software.
      - stays hidden in the computer

      - Powerful Backdoor
      - Unlike Backdoors, Rootkit Cannot be detected by observing :
          - Registry
          - System Task List
          - Services

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ## 4)  Proxy Server Trojans:

          - Standalone application (autonomous app)

          - allows remote attackers to use
            VICTIM’s computer AS A PROXY
                    to connect to the Internet.

          - Starts a Hidden proxy Server on
                    the infected victim’s computer.

          - Attackers use it for
                    anonymous Telnet, ICQ, or IRC
                        to purchase goods using stolen credit cards,...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 5)  Service Protocol Trojan :

          -  take advantage of vulnerable service protocols like:

                              - VNC
                              - HTTP/ HTTPS
                              - ICMP

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6)  CCTT Trojan :

    - Covert Channel Tunneling Tool (CCTT)

    - various exploitation techniques:

          a- Creates arbitrary data transfer channels in
                      DATA STREAMS authorized
            by a network access control system

          b- Gets an external server shell from
                      within the internal network and vice-versa

          c- Sets a TCP/UDP/HTTP CONNECT|POST channel

          d- allowing TCP data streams (SSH, SMTP, POP, etc...)
             between
                         external server
                              and
                        internal network system

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7) Command Shell Trojan :

      - Gives remote control of a command shell on a victim’s machine

        a- Server :  - Installed on the victim's machine
          	         - Opens a port
                     - Attacker connects to that port

        b- Client:	- Installed on the attacker's machine,
                    - Launch a command shell on the victim’s machine


        Latest Command Shell Trojans :
                                        -  Netcat
                                        -  DNS Messenger
                                        -  GCat
