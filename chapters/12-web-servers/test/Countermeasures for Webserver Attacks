Which of the following tools can be used to detect web server hacking attempts and alert you through emails?



        Nessus

        Netcraft

        WebsiteCDS : TRUE
                      website change detection system
                      can detect hacking attempts on the web server.
                      script that
                                  goes through your entire web folder
                                & detects any changes made to your code base
                                & alerts you using email.

Which of the following is
            NOT a DEFENSIVE measure for web server attacks
              while implementing
                Machine.config?




      Restrict code access security policy settings

      Ensure that tracing is enabled <trace enable="true"/>
                            and debug compiles are turned on                  : TRUE

      Limit inbound traffic to port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS (SSL)

      Encrypt or restrict intranet traffic


Explanation:

Machine.config is the mechanism of

             securing information by

                      changing the machine LEVEL SETTINGS.

This effect applies to all other applications.

Machine.config file includes

            machine settings for the .Net framework
                                              that affects the security.

While implementing Machine.config,

          always ensure that TRACING is DISABLED, that is,

                        <trace enable="false"/>

                in order to defend against web server attacks,

            and meanwhile you must also ensure that the

                        DEBUG COMPILES are turned OFF.

Which of the following is NOT a DEFENSIVE measure for web server attacks?



              Ensure that  : PROTECTED RESOURCES are mapped to HttpForbiddenHandler
                           & unused HttpModules are removed

              Configure IIS to accept URLs with "../"                 : TRUE

              Limit inbound traffic to port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS (SSL)

              Encrypt or restrict intranet traffic

----------------------------------------------------------

Which of the following security tools helps to prevent potentially harmful HTTP requests from reaching applications on the server?


        URLScan  : TRUE

        Nmap

        Netcraft

        Nessus

-----------------------------------------------------------

Which of the following is NOT a best approach to protect your firm against web server attacks?



        Remove unnecessary ISAPI filters from the web server

        Apply restricted ACLs

        Allow remote registry administration  :       TRUE

        Secure the SAM (Stand-alone Servers Only)


----------------------------------------------------

Choose an ICANN accredited registrar and encourage them to

    set registrar-lock on the domain name in order to avoid which attack?



        Denial-of-Service Attack

        Man-in-the-Middle Attack

        DNS Hijacking Attack :                  TRUE

        Session Hijacking Attack

Which of the following technique defends servers against BLIND RESPONSE FORGERY?


      UDP source port randomization                                   : TRUE

      Removal of carriage returns (CRs) and linefeeds (LFs)

      Disallow carriage return (%0d or \r) and line feed (%0a or \n) characters

      Restriction of web application access to unique IPs


  Explanation:

  UDP source port randomization
          technique
          defends servers against blind response forgery.
          Limit the number of simultaneous recursive queries
          Increase the times-to-live (TTL) of legitimate records.

  Following are some of the methods to defend against HTTP response-splitting and web cache poisoning:

      Server Admin:

      Use latest web server software
      Regularly update/patch OS and web server
      Run web vulnerability scanner
      Application Developers:

      Restrict web application access to unique IPs
      Disallow carriage return (%0d or \r) and line feed (%0a or \n) characters
      Comply to RFC 2616 specifications for HTTP/1.1


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Which of the following is NOT a best approach to
    protect your firm against web server files and directories?



        Disable serving certain file types by creating a resource mapping

        Avoid mapping virtual directories between two different servers, or over a network

        Enable serving of directory listings     : TRUE

        Eliminate unnecessary files within the .jar files



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Where should a web server be placed in a network in order to provide the most security?




        Outside an unsecured network

        Inside an unsecured network

        Inside DeMilitarized Zones (DMZ) : TRUE

        Outside a secure network

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Which of the following is not a session hijacking technique?




      DNS hijacking               :       TRUE

      Session fixation

      Session sidejacking

      Cross-site scripting


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Attackers use GET and CONNECT requests to use vulnerable web servers as which of the following?




          Proxies :             TRUE

          None of the above

          DNS Servers

          Application Servers


  Explanation:

  Sometimes, web servers are configured to perform functions such as
                forwarding or reverse HTTP proxy.

  Web servers with these functions enabled are employed by the attackers
    to perform following attacks:

        Attacking 3rd-party systems on internet
        Connecting to arbitrary hosts on the organizationâ€™s internal network
        Connecting back to other services running on the proxy host itself
        Attackers use GET and CONNECT requests to
                use vulnerable web servers as proxies
                          to connect and obtain information from target systems
                                                        through these proxy web servers.
