Which statement best describes a server type under an N-tier architecture?


        A group of servers with a unique role   : TRUE

        A single server with a specific role

        A group of servers at a specific layer

        A single server at a specific layer

Explanation:

N-tier architecture

    - provides solutions on
                  scalability,
                  security,
                  fault tolerance,
                  reusability, &
                  maintainability
                                    to support enterprise level client-server applications.

    - has 3 separate logical parts,
              each of which is located on a separate physical server.

    - main advantage : each part or a group of servers is
                              responsible for specific functionality or role.

  =>  In the  N-tier architecture,
              several machines or clusters of machines are deployed,
                    ensuring that services are provided
                              without resources being shared
                              and performing specific functionality.

Which of the following stores critical HTML files
                      related to the webpages of a domain name
                              that will be served in response to requests?


                  Virtual document tree

                  Server root

                  Document root         :  TRUE

                  Web proxy


Explanation:

  DOCUMENT ROOT

    -  1 of  WEBSERVER’s ROOT file directories

    -  stores critical HTML files
                  related to webpages of a domain name that
                                will serve in response to requests.

    For example, if the requested URL is
                          www.certifiedhacker.com
                  & the DOCUMENT ROOT is named as "certroot"
                                          & is stored in "/admin/web" directory,
                  then
                        /admin/web/certroot is the document directory address.

        If the complete request is
                "www.certifiedhacker.com/P-folio/index.html",

        the server will search for the file path
                    ""/admin/web/certroot/P-folio/index.html"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Which of the following stores a server’s
          configuration, error, executable, & log files?


              Server root :                 TRUE

              Virtual document tree

              Document root

              Web proxy

Explanation:

SERVER ROOT

      - top-level root directory
      - under the directory tree in which server's
               configuration
               error ,
               executable,
               log files

                          are stored.



The SERVER ROOT , in general, consists of 4 files

  1 :  File dedicated to the

          CODE

            that implements the server

& following subdirectories :

  2 :  -conf  :   used for configuration information

  3 :  -logs :    used to store logs

  4 :  -cgi-bin:  used for executables.

Which of the following provides storage on a different machine or disk after the original disk is filled up?


          Virtual document tree :       TRUE

          Virtual hosting

          Document root

          Server root

  Explanation:

  VIRTUAL DOCUMENT TREE

      - provides storage on a different machine or a disk after the original disk is filled up.

      - case sensitive

      - provide object-level security.

  In the example under document root,
  
      for a request of www.certifiedhacker.com/P-folio/index.html,
      the server can also search for the file path
              /admin/web/certroot/P-folio/index.html
      if
              admin/web/certroot
                      is stored in another disk.

An attacker sends numerous fake requests to the webserver
    from various random systems
        that results in the webserver crashing
                                   or becoming unavailable
        to the legitimate users.

              DNS amplification attack

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

If an attacker
        compromises a DNS server &
        changes the DNS settings so that
              all requests coming to the target webserver are

then which attack did he perform?


        DoS attack

        DNS server hijacking         : TRUE

-----------------------------------------------------------------

If an attacker uses ../ (dot-dot-slash) sequence to access restricted directories outside of the webserver root directory, then which attack did he perform?


            Directory traversal attack   : TRUE

            HTTP response splitting attack

            DNS amplification attack

            DoS attack


-------------------------------------------------------------------

Which of the following attacks allows an attacker to
    access sensitive information by intercepting & altering communications
      between an end user and webservers?


          HTTP response splitting attack

          Man-in-the-middle attack     :  TRUE

          Directory traversal attack


---------------------------------------------------------------------

      maliciously alters the visual appearance of a webpage by
                  inserting or substituting provocative, and frequently, offending data?


        Website defacement      :      TRUE

        Directory traversal attack

        HTTP response splitting attack

        Man-in-the-middle attack
