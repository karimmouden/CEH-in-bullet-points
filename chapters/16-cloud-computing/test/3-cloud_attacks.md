### An attacker creates anonymous access to the cloud services to carry out various attacks such as password and key cracking, hosting malicious data, and DDoS attack. 

## Which of the following threats is he posing to the cloud platform?

#### Abuse and Nefarious Use of Cloud services:

        - Presence of WEAK REGISTRATION systems in the cloud-computing environment gives rise to this threat.
        - Attackers create anonymous access to cloud services and perpetrate various attacks such as :
                        - password and critical cracking, 
                        - building rainbow tables, 
                        - CAPTCHA-solving farms, 
                        - launching dynamic attack points, 
                        - hosting exploits on cloud platforms, 
                        - hosting malicious data, 
                        - Botnet command or control, 
                        - DDoS, etc.

#### Insecure Interface and APIs: 

        Attackers exploit :
   
                - user defined policies
                - reusable passwords/tokens
                - insufficient input-data validation.

#### Data Breach/Loss: 
        
        Attackers gain illegal access to the data and misuse or modify the data.

#### Insufficient Due Diligence: 

        Ignorance of CSP’s cloud environment poses risks in operational responsibilities such as :
                  - security,
                  - encryption,
                  - incident response,
                  - and more issues such as
                             - contractual issues,
                             - design and architectural issues, etc.

## A privilege escalation threat is caused due to which of the following weaknesses?

#### privilege escalation: 
                      A mistake in the access allocation system such as coding errors, design flaws, and others can result in a customer,
                      third party, or employee obtaining more access rights than required.
                      
                      This threat arises because of - AAA (authentication, authorization, and accountability) vulnerabilities,
                                                    - user-provisioning and de-provisioning vulnerabilities,
                                                    - hypervisor vulnerabilities,
                                                    - unclear roles and responsibilities,
                                                    - misconfiguration, and others.
                                                    
#### Illegal Access to the Cloud: 
        
                'Weak authentication & authorization'  controls could lead to :
                
                        - illegal access 
                        
                  thereby compromising :
                                
                                - confidential & critical data stored in the cloud.

#### Isolation Failure: 
                
                Due to isolation failure, cloud customers can : 
                        
                                - gain illegal access to the data.

#### Modifying Network Traffic: 
                
                Due to flaws while provisioning or de-provisioning network or vulnerabilities in communication encryption.

                        - and then launches a side channel attack.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## advantage of shared physical resources (processor cache) to steal data (cryptographic key) from the victim.

## Which of the following attacks he is performing?

  #### Side Channel Attack: 
  
         - Attacker compromises the cloud by 'placing a MALICIOUS VM near a target cloud server' 
         - & then launch side channel attack.
         
          - attacker runs a virtual machine on the same physical host of the victim’s virtual machine 
          - & takes advantage of :
          
                        - shared physical resources (processor cache) to

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In which of the following attacks does an attacker ride an active computer session by sending an email or tricking the user into visiting a
malicious web page while they are logged into the targeted site?

#### Session Hijacking Using Session Riding: Attackers exploit websites by engaging in cross-site request forgeries to transmit unauthorized commands. In session riding, attackers “ride” an active computer session by sending an email or tricking users to visit a malicious web page, during login, to an actual target site. When users click the malicious link, the website executes the request as if the user had already authenticated it. Commands used include modifying or deleting user data, performing online transactions, resetting passwords, and others.

#### Wrapping Attack: It is performed during the translation of SOAP messages in the TLS layer, where attackers duplicate the body of the message and send it
to the server as a legitimate user.
#### DNS Attack: The attacker performs DNS attacks to obtain authentication credentials from Internet users.
#### Side Channel Attack: The attacker compromises the cloud by placing a malicious virtual machine near a target cloud server and then launches
 a side channel attack.

                        - shared physical resources (processor cache) to 
                                        
                                        steal data (cryptographic key) from the victim.
                        
         - can be implemented by any co-resident user

#### Privilege Escalation

#### Man-In- The-Middle (MiTM)

#### Denial-Of- Service (DoS)

#### Port Scanning
        Port scanning is correct because it is not an attack

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## In which of the following cloud computing threats does an attacker try to control operations of other cloud customers to gain illegal access to the data?

#### Isolation Failure: 

         Multi-tenancy and shared resources are the characteristics of cloud computing.
         Strong isolation or compartmentalization of storage, memory, routing, and reputation among different tenants is lacking.
         Because of isolation failure, attackers try to control operations of other cloud customers to gain illegal access to the data.
 
#### Privilege Escalation: 

        A mistake in the access allocation system causes a customer, third party, or employee to get more access rights than needed.

#### Illegal Access to the cloud: 

        Attackers can exploit weak authentication and authorization to get illegal access, thereby compromising confidential and critical data stored in the cloud.

#### Supply Chain Failure: 
        A disruption in the chain may lead to loss of data privacy and integrity, unavailability of services, violation of SLA, economic and reputational losses resulting in failure to meet customer demand, and cascading failure.
