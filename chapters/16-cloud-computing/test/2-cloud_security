Cloud Security Control Layers

//////////////////////////////
      ?	Information Layer

      Develop & document an

          Information Security Management Program (ISMP),

            which includes

                - administrative safeguards,
                - technical safeguards,
                - physical safeguards

        to protect information against :
          - unauthorized access,
          - modification
          - deletion.

      Some of the information layer security controls include :
              - DLP,
              - CMF,
              - database activity monitoring,
              - encryption, etc.

///////////////////////////////
      ?	Trusted Computing

      Trust computing defines secured computational environment that implements :
          internal control, auditability, and maintenance to ensure :
                    - availability
                    - integrity of cloud operations.

      Hardware and software RoT & API's are few security controls for trusted computing.
      Roots of Trust (RoT) is a set of functions in the trusted computing module that is always trusted by the computer’s operating system (OS).

         The RoT serves as separate compute engine controlling
                    the trusted computing platform cryptographic processor
                                     on the PC or mobile device
                                          it is embedded in.

         The RoT provides the functionality behind trusted computing features including
           -> On the fly drive encryption.
           -> Detection and reporting of unauthorized changes to the operating system or programs.
           -> Detection of rootkits.
           -> Memory curtaining to prevent programs from inappropriately reading from or writing to another program's memory.

         Hardware-based digital rights management (DRM) support.

                - physical plant security
                - fences
                - walls
                - barriers
                - guards
                - gates
                - electronic surveillance

                - physical authentication mechanisms
                - security patrols, and so on.

      ?	Application Layer

      To harden the application layer, establish the policies that match with industry adoption security standards, for example, OWASP for a web application.
      It should meet and comply with appropriate regulatory and business requirements.
      Some of the application layer controls include SDLC, binary analysis, scanners, web app firewalls, transactional sec, etc.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The components such as NIDS/NIPS, firewalls, DPI, Anti-DDoS, QoS, DNSSEC, and OAuth are included in which of the following cloud security control layers?

- Network Layer : It deals with various measures and policies adopted by a network administrator to monitor and prevent illegal access, misuse,
modification, or denial of network-accessible resources.
                Some of the additional network layer security controls include NIDS/NIPS, firewalls, DPI, anti-DDoS, QoS, DNSSEC, OAuth, etc.

- Application Layer

 for example, OWASP for a web application.
 It should meet and comply with appropriate regulatory and business requirements.
  Some of the application layer controls include SDLC, binary analysis, scanners, web app firewalls, transactional sec, etc.

- Management Layer
  This layer covers the cloud security administrative tasks, which can facilitate continued, uninterrupted, and effective services of the cloud.
 Cloud consumers should look for the above-mentioned policies to avail better services.
 Some of the management layer security controls include GRC, IAM, VA/VM, patch management, configuration management, monitoring, etc.

 - Computation and Storage
In cloud due to the lack of physical control of the data and the machine, the service provider may be unable to manage the data and computation and
lose the trust of the cloud consumers.
Cloud provider must establish policies and procedures for data storage and retention.
Cloud provider should implement appropriate backup mechanisms to ensure availability and continuity of services that meet with statutory,
regulatory, contractual, or business requirements and compliance. Host-based firewalls, HIDS/HIPS, integrity and file/log management,
encryption, masking are some security controls in computation and storage.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Which of the following mechanisms should be incorporated into the cloud services to facilitate networks and resources to improve the response time of
 a job with maximum throughput?

 Cloud load balancing is the process of distributing workloads and computing resources in a cloud computing environment.
 Load balancing allows enterprises to manage application or workload demands by allocating resources among multiple computers, networks, or servers.
 Cloud load balancing involves hosting the distribution of workload traffic and demands that reside over the Internet.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Which of the following categories of security controls strengthens the system against incidents by minimizing or eliminating vulnerabilities?

 Preventive Controls: These controls strengthen the system against incidents, probably by minimizing or eliminating vulnerabilities.
                      Example: Strong authentication mechanism to prevent unauthorized use of cloud systems.

 Deterrent Controls: These controls reduce attacks on the cloud system.
                    Example: Warning sign on the fence or property to inform adverse consequences for potential attackers if they proceed to attack
 Detective Controls: These controls detect and react appropriately to the incidents that happen.
                     Example: Employing IDSs, IPSs, etc. helps to detect attacks on cloud systems.
 Corrective controls: These controls minimize the consequences of an incident, probably by limiting the damage.
                     Example: Restoring system backups.

such as the Internet.
However, TCP, UDP, and FTP are a type of network protocol.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Which of the following is NOT a best practice for cloud security?

Provide unauthorized server access using security checkpoints

Some of the Best Practices for Securing Cloud
?	Enforce data protection, backup, and retention mechanisms
?	Enforce SLAs for patching and vulnerability remediation
?	Vendors should regularly undergo AICPA SAS 70 Type II audits
?	Verify one’s cloud in public domain blacklists
?	Enforce legal contracts in employee behavior policy
?	Prohibit user credentials sharing among users, applications, and services
?	Implement secure authentication, authorization, and auditing mechanisms
?	Check for data protection at both design and runtime
?	Implement strong key generation, storage and management, and destruction practices
?	Monitor the client’s traffic for any malicious activities
?	Prevent unauthorized server access using security checkpoints
?	Disclose applicable logs and data to customers
?	Analyze cloud provider security policies and SLAs
?	Assess security of cloud APIs and also log customer network traffic
Providing unauthorized server access using security checkpoints is not a good practice however Preventing unauthorized server access using
security checkpoints is a good practice for cloud security.

Explanation:
Detective controls: These controls detect and react appropriately to the incidents that happen.
For Example, employing IDSs, IPSs, and so on helps to detect attacks on cloud systems.
