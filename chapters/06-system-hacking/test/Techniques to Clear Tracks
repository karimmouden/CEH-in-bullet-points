Which of the following techniques do attackers use to cover the tracks?


-Scanning

-Disable auditing :TRUE

-Steganalysis

-Steganography

Explanation:

Steganography:
    refers to the art of hiding data “behind”
          other data
              without the target’s knowledge.

Steganalysis:
      Process of discovering
              existence of hidden information in a medium.

Disable auditing:
      Technique where an attacker
            disables auditing features of the target system
                to cover  tracks.

Scanning: This refers to a set of procedures used
                  for identifying
                      hosts,
                      ports, and
                      services
                                in a network.

Identify the technique used by the attackers to wipe out the entries corresponding to their activities in the system log to remain undetected?


-Executing applications

-Gaining access

-Clearing logs : TRUE

-Escalating privileges

Explanation:

Executing Applications:
      Once attackers have administrator privileges,
      they attempt to install malicious programs such as
            Trojans, Backdoors, Rootkits, and Keyloggers,
            which grant them remote system access,
            thereby enabling them to execute malicious codes remotely.
      Installing Rootkits allows them
                to gain access at the OS level
                      to perform malicious activities.
      To maintain access for use at a later date,
              they may install Backdoors.

Escalating Privileges:
      After gaining access to a system using a low-privileged normal user account,
              attackers may then try to increase their administrator privileges
                          to perform protected system operations,
                                  so that they can proceed to the next level of the system hacking phase:
                                          execute applications.
      Attackers exploit known system vulnerabilities to escalate user privileges.

Gaining Access: In system hacking,
                    the attacker first tries to gain access to a target system using
                              - information obtained
                              - loopholes found in the system’s access control mechanism.
                  Once attackers succeed in gaining access to the system,
                          they are free to perform malicious activities such as
                                        stealing sensitive data,
                                        implementing a sniffer to capture network traffic, and
                                        infecting the system with malware.

Clearing Logs: To maintain future system access,
                          attackers attempt to
                                  avoid recognition by legitimate system users.
               To remain undetected, attackers
                          wipe out the entries corresponding to their activities in the system log,
                                  thus avoiding detection by users.

Which of the following techniques is used by the attackers to clear online tracks?




-Disable auditing     : TRUE

-Disable LAN manager

-Disable LMNR and NBT-NS services

-Disable the user account


Explanation:
      Techniques used for Clearing Tracks

      The main activities that an attacker performs toward removing his/her traces on the computer are:

            Disable auditing:
                  An attacker disables auditing features of the target system
            Clearing logs:
                  An attacker clears/deletes the system log entries corresponding to his/her activities
            Manipulating logs:
                  An attacker manipulates logs in such a way that he/she will not be caught in legal actions

Which of the following is an
    sh-compatible shell that
    stores command history in a file?


      - ksh

      - BASH : TRUE

      - Tcsh/Csh

      - Zsh


      Explanation:

BASH: The BASH or Bourne Again Shell
          is an sh-compatible shell
          stores command history in a file called bash history.
          You can view the saved command history using more ~/.bash_history command.
          This feature of BASH is a problem for hackers as the bash_history file could be used by investigators
          in order to track the origin of an attack and the exact commands used by an intruder in order to compromise a system.

Tcsh:
      This is a Unix shell and compatible with C shell.
      It comes with features such as command-line completion and editing, etc.
      Users cannot define functions using tcsh script.
      They need to use scripts such as Csh to write functions.

Zsh: This shell can be used as
          an interactive login shell
      as well as
          a command-line interpreter for writing shell scripts.

     It is an extension of the Bourne shell (BASH)
     It includes a vast number of improvements.

Ksh: It improved version of the Bourne shell that includes
                floating-point arithmetic,
                job control,
                command aliasing, and
                command completion.

------------------

Which of the following commands is used to
disable the BASH shell from saving the history?


- history –c

- export HISTSIZE=0   : TRUE

- history -w

- shred ~/.bash_history

Explanation:

      history –c:               This command is useful in
                                      clearing the stored history.

      export HISTSIZE=0:       This command
                                      disables the BASH shell from saving  history
                                            by setting the
                                                    size of the history file to 0.

      history–w:               This command
                                      only deletes the history of the current shell,
                                                whereas the command
                                                          history of other shells remain unaffected.

      shred ~/.bash_history:   This command
                                    shreds the history file,
                                            making its contents unreadable.

Which of the following technique is used by the attacker
    to distribute the payload &
    to create covert channels?


      - Clear online tracks

      - Performing steganalysis

      - TCP Parameters        : TRUE

      - Covering tracks


      Explanation:
      TCP Parameters: TCP parameters can be used by the attacker to
                              - distribute the payload
                              - create covert channels.
                     Some of the TCP fields where data can be hidden are as follow:

                            1)  IP Identification field: Easy approach where
                                                            a payload is transferred bitwise
                                                                      over an established session
                                                                              between two systems
                                                      Here, 1 character is encapsulated per packet.

                            2)  TCP acknowledgement number: Quite difficult approach as it
                                                                  uses a bounce server that
                                                                        receives packets from the victim &
                                                                        sends it to an attacker.
                                                                  Here, 1 hidden character is relayed
                                                                          by the bounce server
                                                                                per packet.

                            3)  TCP initial sequence number: Does not require an established connection between two systems.
                                                             Here, 1 hidden character is encapsulated per
                                                                        SYN request & Reset packets.

Which of the following registry entry you will delete to clear Most Recently Used (MRU) list?


HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\AppKey

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\RecentDocs : TRUE

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\MountPoints2

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FileExts


Explanation:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\AppKey              stores the hotkeys.
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FileExts             responsible for file extension association.
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\RecentDocs          key maintains a list
                                                                                                of recently opened
                                                                                            or saved files
                                                                                                  via Windows Explorer-style dialog boxes.
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\MountPoints2         stores the network locations.


---------------------
In a Windows system, an attacker was found to have run the following command:
type C:\SecretFile.txt >C:\LegitFile.txt:SecretFile.txt
What does the above command indicate?


The attacker has used Alternate Data Streams to hide SecretFile.txt file into LegitFile.txt. : TRUE

The attacker has used Alternate Data Streams to copy the content of SecretFile.txt file into LegitFile.txt.

The attacker has used Alternate Data Streams to rename SecretFile.txt file to LegitFile.txt.

The attacker was trying to view SecretFile.txt file hidden using an Alternate Data Stream.


Explanation:
NTFS has a feature called as Alternate Data Streams that allows attackers to hide a file behind other normal files. Given below are some steps in order to hide file using NTFS:

1) Open the command prompt
        with an elevated privilege

2) Type the command
          “type C:\SecretFile.txt >C:\LegitFile.txt:SecretFile.txt”
(here, LegitFile.txt file is kept in C drive where SecretFile.txt file is hidden inside LegitFile.txt file)

3) To view the hidden file,
        type
            “more < C:\SecretFile.txt”
             (for this you need to know the hidden file name)
