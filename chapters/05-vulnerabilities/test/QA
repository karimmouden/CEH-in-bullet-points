Unauthenticated access : Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is a File Transfer Protocol that allows a client to get a file from or put a file onto a remote host.
                         This protocol includes no login or access control mechanisms, and therefore it is recommended to take care when
                         using this protocol for file transfers where authentication, access control, confidentiality, or integrity checking are needed.
                         Otherwise, it may result in unauthorized access to remote host.

Which of the following techniques helps the attacker in identifying the OS used on the target host in order to detect vulnerabilities on a target system?

Banner grabbing: Banner grabbing or OS fingerprinting is the method used to determine the operating system running on a remote target system.
                Identifying the OS used on the target host allows an attacker to figure out the vulnerabilities the system posses and the exploits
                that might work on a system to further carry out additional attacks.

Port scanning: Port scanning is the process of checking the services running on the target computer
               by sending a sequence of messages in an attempt to break in.

Source Routing: Source routing refers to sending a packet to the intended destination
                with partially or completely specified route (without firewall-/IDS-configured routers)
                in order to evade IDS/firewall.
IP address decoy: IP address decoy technique refers to generating or manually specifying IP addresses of the decoys
                  in order to evade IDS/firewall.

Which of the following business challenges could be solved by using a vulnerability scanner?


There is an urgent need to remove administrator access from multiple machines for an employee who quit.

There is a monthly requirement to test corporate compliance with host application usage and security policies : True

Auditors want to discover if all systems are following a standard naming convention.

A web server was compromised and management needs to know if any further systems were compromised.

        Explanation:
        Vulnerability scanners help in analyzing and identifying vulnerabilities in the target network or network resources
        by means of vulnerability assessment and network auditing.
        These tools also assist in overcoming weaknesses in the network by suggesting various remediation techniques.
        Vulnerability scanners are used to test corporate compliance with host application usage and security policies.
        Any deviation from a standard or baseline security configuration is marked as a vulnerability.

        Vulnerability scanners generally scan for different network nodes and discover hostnames, but they cannot determine
        if all systems are following a standard naming convention.
        They can also not ascertain if the systems are already compromised.
        Vulnerability scanners cannot be used to remove administrator access from multiple machines.

Which of the following settings enables Nessus to detect when it is sending too many packets and the network pipe is approaching capacity?


Silent Dependencies

Consider unscanned ports as closed

Netstat WMI Scan

Reduce parallel connections on congestion : True

Explanation :
The Netstat WMI scan finds open ports in the Windows system.
Silent dependencies limit the amount of plugin data.
According to Nessus Network Auditing, edited by Russ Rogers, ‘Consider unscanned ports as closed’ will tell Nessus
that all other ports not included in the port range scan to be considered as closed.
This prevents ports that are targeted against ports outside that range from running.”

Which term refers to common software vulnerabilities that happen due to coding errors allowing attackers to get access to the target system ?


Buffer overflows

Buffer overflows are common software vulnerabilities that happen due to coding errors allowing attackers to get access to the target system.
In a buffer overflow attack, attackers undermine the functioning of programs and try to take the control of the system
by writing content beyond the allocated size of the buffer.
Insufficient bounds checking in the program is the root cause because of which the buffer is not able to handle data beyond its limit,
causing the flow of data to adjacent memory locations and overwriting their data values.
Systems often crash or become unstable or show erratic program behavior when buffer overflow occurs.

Active footprinting

Active footprinting involves gathering information about the target with direct interaction.
In active footprinting, information is gathered by querying published name servers, extracting metadata, web spidering, Whois lookup, etc.

Port scanning

Port scanning is the process of checking the services running on the target computer by sending a sequence of messages in an attempt to break in.
Port scanning involves connecting to or probing TCP and UDP ports on the target system
to determine if the services are running or are in a listening state.

Which of the following term refers to the process of reducing the severity of vulnerabilities in vulnerability management life cycle?


Vulnerability Assessment

Remediation : True

Verification

Risk Assessment

Explanation:
Vulnerability management life cycle is an important process that helps in finding and remediating security weaknesses before they are exploited.
This includes
      defining the risk posture and policies for an organization,
      creating a complete asset list of systems,
      scanning and assessing the environment for vulnerabilities and exposures,
 and  taking action to mitigate the vulnerabilities that are found.

The phases involved in vulnerability management are:

?        Creating Baseline

In this phase, critical assets are identified and prioritized to create a good baseline for the vulnerability management.

?        Vulnerability Assessment

This is a very crucial phase in vulnerability management. In this step, the security analyst identifies the known vulnerabilities in the organization infrastructure.

?        Risk Assessment

In this phase, all the serious uncertainties that are associated with the system are assessed, fixed, and permanently eliminated for ensuring a flaw free system.

?        Remediation

Remediation is the process of reducing the severity of vulnerabilities.
This phase is initiated after the successful implementation of the baseline and assessment steps.

?        Verification

This phase provides a clear visibility into the firm and allows the security team to check whether all the previous phases are perfectly employed or not.

?        Monitor

Regular monitoring needs to be performed for maintaining the system security using tools such as IDS/IPS, firewalls, etc.
