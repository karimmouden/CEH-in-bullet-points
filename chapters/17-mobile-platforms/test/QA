Which of the following mobile Bluetooth attacks enables an attacker to gain remote access to the victims mobile and use its features without the victim’s
knowledge or consent?


BlueSniff

Bluebugging : Gaining remote access to a target Bluetooth-enabled device and use its features without a victim’s knowledge or consent.
              Attackers compromise the target device’s security to create a backdoor attack prior to returning control of it to its owner.
              Bluebugging allows attackers to :
                    - sniff sensitive corporate or personal data,
                    - receive calls and text messages intended for the victim,
                    - intercept phone calls and messages
                    - forward calls and messages
                    - connect to the Internet and perform other malicious activities such as accessing contact lists, photos, and videos.

Bluesmacking

Bluesnarfing




----------------

If an attacker is able to access the email contact list, text messages, photos, etc. on your mobile device, then what type of attack did the attacker employ?


Bluesnarfing : Theft of information from a wireless device through a Bluetooth connection,
               Happens between phones, desktops, laptops, PDAs, and others.
               Allows an attacker to access the victim’s contact list, emails, text messages, photos, videos, business data, and so on stored on the device.
               Any device with its Bluetooth connection enabled and set to “discoverable” or “discovery” mode (allowing other
               Bluetooth devices within range to view the device) may be susceptible to bluesnarfing if the vendor’s software contains certain vulnerabilities.
               Bluesnarfing exploits others’ Bluetooth connections without their knowledge.

Which of the following technique helps protect mobile systems and users by limiting the resources the mobile application can access on the mobile platform?


Firewall : software- or hardware-based system located at the network gateway
           protects  resources of a private network from unauthorized access of users on other networks.

Sandbox :Security mechanism that helps protect systems and users by limiting resources the app can access to its intended functionality on the mobile platform.
         Often, sandboxing is useful in executing untested code or untrusted programs from unverified third parties, suppliers, untrusted users, and untrusted websites.

Anti-Malware : Provides protection against malware, ransomware, and other growing threats to mobile devices.

Spam Filter : Filters & protects user emails against :  viruses, malware, phishing emails, DoS attacks etc.

----------------------

Which of the following attacks can be performed by Spam messages?


Phishing Attacks : Attackers perform phishing attack on mobile devices through spam messages or emails.
                   Phishing emails or pop-ups redirect users to fake web pages of mimicking trustworthy sites that ask them to submit their
                   personal information such as usernames, passwords, credit card details, address, and mobile number.

Denial-of-Service Attacks

Bluesnarfing Attacks:

Wardriving Attacks : In a wardriving attack, wireless LANS are detected either by :
                                    - sending probe requests over a connection
                                or  - by listening to web beacons.
                     An attacker who discovers a penetration point can launch further attacks on the LAN.

Which of the following processes is supposed to install a modified set of kernel patches that allows users to run third-party applications not signed by the OS vendor?


Spear-Phishing

JailBreaking : Jailbreaking is defined as the process of installing a modified set of kernel patches
                    that allows users to run 3rd-party applications not signed by the OS vendor.
               It is the process of bypassing user limitations set by Apple, such as :
                    - modifying the OS,
                    - attaining admin privileges,
                    - and installing unofficially approved apps via “side loading.”
               You can accomplish jailbreaking simply by modifying iOS system kernels.
               A reason for jailbreaking iOS devices such as iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch is to expand the feature set restricted by Apple and its App Store.
               It provides root access to the OS
                  permits downloading of third-party applications, themes, and extensions that are unavailable through the official Apple App Store.
                  Jailbreaking also removes sandbox restrictions, which enables malicious apps to access restricted mobile resources and information.

-------------------
Which of the following statements is not true for securing iOS devices?


Disable Jailbreak detection : Jailbreak detection has to be enabled all the time in any iOS device.
                              Disabling Jailbreaking detection in the device cannot secure the device from jailbreaking and once if
                                jailbreaking has been performed on the device, the device can be prone to installation of applications from
                                any untrusted sources and can also lead to various attacks that can cause data theft.

                                - the kernel will be patched without the help of a computer – in other words, it will be jailbroken after each reboot.

None of the Above

Tethered Jailbreaking

Semi-Tethered Jailbreaking

-----------------------------

                                      - the device will start up completely;
                                      - it will no longer have a patched kernel,
                                      - but it will still be usable for normal functions.
