An attacker is sending
        spoofed router advertisement messages so that
              all the data packets travel through his system.
Then the attacker is trying to sniff the traffic to
        collect valuable information from the data packets to
                launch further attacks such as
                          man-in-the-middle, denial-of-service, and passive sniffing attacks on the target network.

Which of the following technique is the attacker using in the above scenario?

//////////////////
ARP Spoofing :

involves constructing a
        large number of forged ARP request & reply packets
            to overload a switch.

Attackers use this flaw in ARP to
            create malformed ARP replies containing
                      spoofed IP and MAC addresses.

Assuming it to be the legitimate ARP reply,  victim's computer
                              blindly accepts  ARP entry into its ARP table.

Once the ARP table is flooded with spoofed ARP replies, the attacker sets the switch in
              forwarding mode,
                      which intercepts
                                all the data that flows from the victim machine
                                            without the victim being aware of the attack.

/////////////////////
IRDP Spoofing : TRUE

          IRDP Router Discovery Protocol (IRDP)
          Routing protocol

          Allows a host to
                discover  IP addresses of active routers
                      on its subnet
                        by listening to
                            router advertisement & solicitation messages on its network.
                An attacker can use this to send
                            spoofed router advertisement messages so that
                                        all the data packets travel through the attacker's system.
                                          -> Thus, the attacker can
                                                          sniff the traffic
                                                          collect valuable information from the data packets.
                Attackers can use IRDP spoofing to launch
                                    MITM, DoS, and passive sniffing attacks :

              Passive Sniffing: In a switched network, the attacker spoofs IRDP traffic to
                                          re-route  outbound traffic of target hosts through  attackerâ€™s machine.
              MITM: Once sniffing starts, the attacker acts as
                                  a proxy between the victim and destination.
                    The attacker plays an MITM role and tries to modify the traffic.

              DoS: IDRP spoofing allows remote attackers to add wrong route entries into victims routing table.
                   The wrong address entry causes DoS.

//////////////
DHCP Starvation Attack :
    attacker floods the DHCP server by sending a large number of DHCP requests
             uses all of the available IP addresses that the DHCP server can issue.
    As a result, the server cannot issue any more IP addresses,
          -> leading to Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.

//////////////
MAC Flooding : technique used to
                          compromise the security of network switches that
                                    connect network segments or network devices.
              Attackers use  MAC flooding technique to
                        force a switch to act as a hub,
                                so that they can easily sniff the traffic.

Which of the following DNS poisoning techniques uses
        ARP poisoning
              against switches
                  to  manipulate routing table?


DNS Cache Poisoning

Internet DNS Spoofing

Proxy Server DNS Poisoning

Intranet DNS Spoofing : TRUE

Explanation:
DNS poisoning techniques to sniff the DNS traffic of a target network.
Using this technique, an attacker can
                  obtain the ID of the DNS request by sniffing
                  and
                  can send a malicious reply to the sender before the actual DNS server.

DNS poisoning is possible using the following techniques:
?	 Intranet DNS spoofing
?	Internet DNS spoofing
?	Proxy server DNS poisoning
?	DNS cache poisoning

Intranet DNS spoofing:
          An attacker can perform an intranet DNS spoofing attack on a switched LAN
                  with the help of  ARP poisoning technique.

          To perform this attack, the attacker
                        must be connected to the LAN and
                             be able to sniff the traffic or packets.

          An attacker who succeeds in sniffing
                    the ID of the DNS request from the intranet
                              can send a malicious reply to
                                      the sender
                                            before the actual DNS server.

Internet DNS spoofing:
          Attackers perform Internet DNS spoofing with the help of Trojans when the victimâ€™s system connects to the Internet.
          It is an MITM attack in which the attacker changes the primary DNS entries of the victimâ€™s computer.

Proxy server DNS poisoning:
          In the proxy server DNS poisoning technique, the attacker sets up a proxy server on the attackerâ€™s system.
          The attacker also configures a fraudulent DNS and makes its IP address a primary DNS entry in the proxy server.

DNS cache poisoning:
          Attackers target this DNS cache and make changes or add entries to the DNS cache.
          If the DNS resolver
              cannot validate that the DNS responses have come
                    from an authoritative source,
                              it will cache the incorrect entries locally
                              and
                              serve them to users who make the same request.

A hacker, who posed as a heating and air conditioning specialist,
              was able to install a sniffer program
                      in a switched environment network.
Which attack could have been used by the hacker to sniff all of the packets in the network?


Smurf attack

Tear drop attack :

MAC flood attack : TRUE

        To sniff all the packets in a network,
        the attacker can
          - flood the switch with many Ethernet frames, each containing different source MAC addresses.
          - Check whether the switch enters into
                      fail open mode,
                                in which the switch broadcasts data
                                    to all ports
                                rather than just to
                                   the port intended to receive the data.
        If this happens, then attackers have the ability to sniff network traffic.

They use the same packet capture utility. : TRUE

They are written in Java.

They use the same packet analysis engine.

They send alerts to security monitors.

Explanation:

Snort : open source NIDS (network intrusion detection system),

        capable of performing

              - real time traffic analysis
              - packet logging
              on IP networks.
              - protocol analysis
              - content searching/matching

        used to detect a variety of attacks & probes, such as
              - buffer overflows,
              - stealth port scans,
              - CGI attacks,
              - SMB probes,
              - OS fingerprinting attempts.

        It uses a
            - flexible rules language to
                    describe traffic that it should collect or pass,
            - detection engine that utilizes a modular plug-in architecture.

Uses of Snort:

Straight packet sniffer like tcpdump, Wireshark
Packet logger (useful for network traffic debugging, etc.)
Network intrusion prevention system

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the length of ID number of an organization in a MAC address?


48 bits

24 bits : TRUE

26 bits

12 bits

Explanation:
A MAC address is 48 bits, which splits into two sections, each containing 24 bits.
The first section contains the ID number of the
    organization that manufactured the adapter and is called the organizationally unique identifier.
The next section contains the
    serial number assigned to the NIC adapter and is called the network interface controller (NIC) specific.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What happens when a switch CAM table becomes full?


Every packet is dropped and the switch sends out simple network management protocol (SNMP) alerts to the intrusion detection system (IDS) port.

The switch replaces outgoing frame switch factory default MAC address of FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF.

The CAM overflow table will cause the switch to crash causing denial-of-service (DoS).

The switch then acts as a hub by broadcasting packets to all machines on the network. : TRUE

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What method should be incorporated by a network administrator to prevent the organizationâ€™s network against ARP poisoning?


Use secure shell (SSH) encryption

Use SSL for secure traffic

Resolve all DNS queries to local DNS server

Implement dynamic arp inspection (DAI) using the dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) snooping binding table : TRUE

Explanation:
Implementation of DAI prevents poisoning attacks.

DAI : Dynamic ARP Inspection
      security feature
      validates ARP packets in a network.

      When DAI activates on a VLAN, all ports on the VLAN
                            are considered to be untrusted by default. 

      DAI validates the ARP packets using
                      a DHCP snooping binding table.

DHCP snooping binding table :
      table
      consists of :
          - MAC addresses,
          - IP addresses,
          - VLAN interfaces
          acquired by listening to DHCP message exchanges.

  !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Hence, you must enable DHCP snooping before enabling DAI.!!!!!!!!!!!

   Otherwise, establishing a connection between
              VLAN devices based on ARP is not possible.

  Consequently, a self-imposed DoS attack
        might result on any device in that VLAN.
