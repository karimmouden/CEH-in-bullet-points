A tester wants to
      securely encrypt the session to
                prevent the network against sniffing attack,

which of the following protocols should he use as a replacement of Telnet?


SSH : TRUE
      network protocol
      used to remotely access and manage a device.

      The key difference between
            Telnet & SSH is that
                SSH uses encryption  -> all data transmitted over a network is secure from eavesdropping.

    On a remote device,
        an SSH server must be
              installed & running.

                for the interface on a Cisco switch?


snmp-server enable traps port-security trap-rate 5

switchport port-security maximum 1 vlan access : TRUE

switchport port-security aging time 2

switchport port-security violation restrict


Explanation:
        Configuring Port Security on Cisco switch: You can use the following Cisco port security feature to defend against MAC attacks:

        switchport port-security
              Enables port security on the interface.

        switchport port-security maximum 1 vlan access
              Sets the maximum number of secure MAC addresses for the interface.
              The range is 1 to 3072.
              The default is 1.

        switchport port-security violation restrict
              Sets the violation mode,
              the action to be taken when a security violation {restrict | shutdown} is detected.

        switchport port-security aging time 2
              Sets the aging time for the secure port.

        switchport port-security aging type inactivity
              The type keyword sets the aging type as absolute or inactive.

        snmp-server enable traps port-security trap-rate 5
              Controls the rate at which SNMP traps are generated.

A network administrator wants to configure port security on a Cisco switch.
Which of the following command helps the administrator to enable port security on an interface?

      switchport port-security aging type inactivity

      switchport port-security : TRUE

      switchport port-security aging time 2

      switchport port-security maximum 1

-----------------------

Out of the following options,
identify the function of the following command performed on a Cisco switch.
“switchport port-security mac-address sticky”


Adds all secure MAC addresses that are dynamically learned to the running configuration : TRUE

Configures the switch port parameters to enable port security

Configures the secure MAC address aging time on the port

Configures the maximum number of secure MAC addresses for the port


Explanation:
    "switchport port-security mac-address sticky"
        Enables sticky learning on the interface by entering only the mac-address sticky keywords.
        When sticky learning is enabled, the interface
                  - adds all secure MAC addresses that are dynamically learned to the running configuration
                  - converts these addresses to sticky secure MAC addresses.

                  that restricts the IP traffic on untrusted Layer 2 ports
                        by filtering traffic based on

IP Source Guard:

    security feature in switches
    restricts  IP traffic on untrusted Layer 2 ports by
            filtering traffic based on the DHCP snooping binding database.
    prevents spoofing attacks when
            the attacker
                        tries to spoof
                  or
                        use the IP address of another host.

DHCP Snooping Binding Table:

    DHCP snooping process filters untrusted DHCP messages
                          helps to build and bind a DHCP binding table.
                           This table contains :
                                - MAC address,
                                - IP address,
                                - lease time,

                                - interface information to correspond with untrusted interfaces of a switch.
          It acts as a
                  firewall between
                        untrusted hosts & DHCP servers.

          It also helps in differentiating between
                    - trusted
                    and
                    - untrusted interfaces.

                      IP to MAC address binding
                                for each ARP packet in a network.
          While performing a Dynamic ARP inspection, the system will automatically
                      drop invalid IP to MAC address bindings.

Which of the following is not a mitigation technique against MAC address spoofing?




DHCP Snooping Binding Table

IP Source Guard

DNS Security (DNSSEC) : TRUE

Dynamic ARP Inspection

Explanation:
Following some of the techniques to defend against MAC address spoofing attacks:

IP Source Guard:
      security feature in switches that restricts the IP traffic on untrusted Layer 2 ports by filtering traffic based on the DHCP snooping binding database.
      It prevents spoofing attacks when the attacker tries to spoof or use the IP address of another host.

DHCP Snooping Binding Table:
      The DHCP snooping process filters untrusted DHCP messages and helps to build and bind a DHCP binding table.
      This table contains the
              MAC address, IP address, lease time, binding type, VLAN number, and interface information
          to correspond with untrusted interfaces of a switch.
      It acts as a firewall between untrusted hosts and DHCP servers.
      It also helps in differentiating between trusted and untrusted interfaces.

Dynamic ARP Inspection:
      The system checks the IP to MAC address binding for each ARP packet in a network.
      While performing a Dynamic ARP inspection,
              the system will automatically
                    drop invalid IP to MAC address bindings.

            on 1 or more VLANs?


switchport port-security mac-address sticky

ip dhcp snooping

ip dhcp snooping vlan 4,104       : TRUE

no ip dhcp snooping information option


Explanation:

Cisco OS Global Commands:

ip dhcp snooping vlan 4,104
      Enable or disable DHCP snooping on one or more VLANs.

no ip dhcp snooping information option
      To disable the insertion and the removal of the option-82 field,
            use the no IP dhcp snooping information option in global configuration command.
      To configure an aggregation, switch to drop incoming DHCP snooping packets with option-82 information from an edge switch,
            use the no IP dhcp snooping information option allow-untrusted global configuration command.

ip dhcp snooping
        Enable DHCP snooping option globally.

Configuring Port Security on Cisco switch:

switchport port-security mac-address sticky
        Enables sticky learning on the interface by entering only the mac-address sticky keywords. When sticky learning is enabled,
                    the interface
                        adds all secure MAC addresses that are dynamically learned to
                            the running configuration  
                        converts these addresses to
                            sticky secure MAC addresses.
