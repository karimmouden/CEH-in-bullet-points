A hacker was able to sniff packets on a company’s wireless network. The following information was discovered: the Key 10110010 01001011 and the Ciphertext 01100101 01011010.

Using the exclusive OR function, what was the original message?




              00101000 11101110

              11110010 01011011

              00001101 10100100

              11010111 00010001 : TRUE

Explanation:
XOR or Exclusive OR function is
      a binary logical operation that results in true (1) only when
                one input is true (1) and the other is false (0).

    It returns false (0) when both the inputs are true (1) or false (0).

Example:

Key = 10110010 01001011

Ciphertext = 01100101 01011010

Plaintext or Original Message = 11010111 00010001

A tester is attempting to
    capture and analyze the traffic on
        a given network and
            realizes that the network has several switches.
What could be used to successfully sniff the traffic on this switched network? (Choose three.)


          MAC flooding : TRUE

          Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) spoofing : TRUE

          MAC duplication : TRUE

          SYN flooding

          ARP broadcasting

          Reverse smurf attack

  Explanation:

          ARP spoofing :

              Technique by which an attacker sends (spoofed) ARP messages onto a local area network.
                      associate the attacker’s MAC address with the IP address of another host, such as
                                  the default gateway,
                                    causing any traffic meant for that IP address
                                            to be sent to the attacker instead.

          MAC duplication :

              Executed by an attacker by changing the MAC address of their host
                      to match the MAC address of the target host on the network,
                            making the switch forward the target packets to
                                  both the host on the network.

          MAC flooding :

              Technique employed to compromise the security of the network switches.
                      Switches maintain a list (called a content addressable memory (CAM) table) that
                              maps individual MAC addresses on the network
                                    to the physical ports on the switch.

Out of the following, which layer is responsible for

      encoding & decoding

        data packets
            into
          bits?

//////////////////////////////

Data Link layer : TRUE

                  2nd layer of  OSI model.

                  In this layer, data packets are encoded and decoded
                          into bits often called frames.

                  Sniffers operate at the Data Link layer
                           can capture the packets from the Data Link layer.
//////////////////////////////

Application layer :

              Consists of the protocols used by the applications.
              These applications provide
                    - user services
                    - data
                over the network connections
                          recognized by the lower layer protocols.

Session layer :

      Responsible for :
            -  establishing
            -  maintaining
              sessions between
                    - source

An attacker wants to monitor a target network traffic
      on 1 or more ports on the switch.
 In such a case, which of the following methods can he use?


          Wiretapping

          Port mirroring : TRUE
                  Switched port analyzer (SPAN) is a Cisco switch feature,
                          also known as “port mirroring,” that
                                  monitors network traffic on 1 or more ports on the switch.
                  Port configured to receive a
                          copy of every packet that passes through a switch.
                  Helps to
                      analyze
                      debug data,
                      identify errors, and
                      investigate unauthorized network access on a network.

Which of the following protocols is not vulnerable to sniffing?


            Post Office Protocol (POP)

            Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) : TRUE

            SSL is used to secure connections between network application clients and servers over an insecure network, such as the Internet.

                      SSL uses a combination of public key and symmetric key encryption to
                                      secure a connection between two machines, typically a

                                                                    web or mail server a
                                                                and

                                              communicating over the Internet or another TCP/IP network.

                      SSL provides a mechanism to
                            encrypt & authenticate data sent between
