Which command lets a tester enumerate live systems in a class C network via ICMP using native Windows tools?


            ping 192.168.2.255

  TRUE      for /L %V in (1 1 254) do PING -n 1 192.168.2.%V | FIND /I "Reply"

            ping 192.168.2.

            for %V in (1 1 255) do PING 192.168.2.%V

explanation :

The command below will

              ping all IP addresses on the 192.168.2.0 network
and
              help the tester to determine live systems in the network along with replies.

                      for /L %V in (1 1 254) do PING -n 1 192.168.2.%V | FIND /I "Reply"
Whereas :
"Ping 192.168.2." and "ping 192.168.2.255" will just ping the target IPs
"for %V in (1 1 255) do PING 192.168.2.%V" command does not consist of reply from the host machines

                        from where  NTP server gets time
                    & follows
                        the chain of NTP servers back
                            to its prime time source

          ntpdc: queries ntpd DAEMON  about
                                  its current state
                & requests changes in that state (TRUE)

          ntpq: monitors NTP daemon ntpd operations and determine performance

          Email Recipient's system IP address and geolocation.

          Open ports and services.

Explanation:
Enumeration is the process of extracting
            user names, machine names, network resources, shares, & services
  from a system or network.

Enumeration allows you to collect following information:
?        Network resources
?        Network shares
?        Routing tables
?        Audit and service settings
?        SNMP and FQDN details

      Extract information using "DNS Zone Transfer" :

              use "DNS zone transfer"

                    to REPLICATE
                          DNS DATA across many DNS servers

                  or

                    to BACKUP
                          DNS files.

                The administrator needs to execute a
                      specific zone transfer request
                                    to the name server.

      Extract information using default passwords

      Brute force Active Directory

Which of the following steps in enumeration penetration testing extracts information about
  encryption & hashing algorithms,
  authentication type,
  key distribution algorithms,
  SA LifeDuration, etc.?


    Perform NTP enumeration

    Perform SMTP enumeration

    Perform IPsec enumeration :  True

    Perform DNS enumeration

Explanation:

IPsec provides DATA SECURITY

          by employing various components like

                  ESP (Encapsulation Security Payload),
                  AH (Authentication Header),
                  IKE (Internet Key Exchange)

   to secure communication between VPN end-points.

Attacker use tools like "nmap" to perform

        a simple direct scanning for ISAKMP

                            at UDP port 500

  to acquire  information related to the

                            presence of a VPN gateway.

You can enter the following command to perform Nmap scan

                        for checking the status of ISAKMP over port 500:

            # nmap –sU –p 500 <target IP address>


Attackers can probe further using

      fingerprinting tools such as

                      "ike-scan"

to enumerate the sensitive information including  :

                - encryption
                - hashing algorithm,
                - authentication type,
                - key distribution algorithm,
                - SA LifeDuration, etc.

In this type of scan,

        specially

                crafted IKE packets

                       with ISAKMP header

        are sent to the target Gateway
            and
        responses are recorded.

          nbtstat : True

          GetRequest

          SetRequest

Explanation:

nbtstat

      Windows utility
      displays
                - NetBIOS over TCP/IP  protocol statistics,

                - NetBIOS names tables for both
                              local & remote computers,

                - NetBIOS name cache.

An attacker can run the nbtstat command,

              “nbtstat.exe –c”

    to get the contents of  :

          -  NetBIOS name cache,
          -  table of NetBIOS names,
          -  their resolved IP addresses.

   An attacker can also run :

              “nbtstat.exe –a <IP address of the remote machine>”

                  to get the NetBIOS name table

                        of a remote computer.

  SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)

        application layer protocol

        runs on UDP

        maintains & manages
            routers,
            hubs,
            switches

              Windows & UNIX networks

                        on networking devices.

  SNMP holds 2 passwords to

        access & configure

          SNMP agent
            from the management station:

              ?        Read community string:

                                public by default;
                                allows viewing of device/system configuration

                                allows remote editing of configuration

  Attacker uses these default community strings to
              extract information about a device

  Attackers enumerate SNMP to

              extract information about "network RESOURCES" such as  :

LDAP :
        Lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP)

        Internet protocol

        used for accessing

                distributed directory services.

        Directory services may provide any

          often in a

                  HIEARCHICAL & LOGICAL structure.

        An attacker queries LDAP service to gather information such as

              valid user names,
              addresses,
              departmental details, and so on

          -  mailing lists?


    PSINFO

    VRFY

    RCPT TO

    EXPN


    Explanation:
    Mail systems commonly use SMTP with POP3 and IMAP that enables users to save the messages in the server mailbox and download them occasionally from the server. SMTP uses Mail Exchange (MX) servers to direct the mail via DNS. It runs on TCP port 25.

    SMTP provides 3 built-in-commands:

    ?        VRFY - Validates users

    ?        EXPN - returns the actual delivery addresses of aliases and mailing lists

    ?        RCPT TO - Defines the recipients of the message

    SMTP servers respond differently to VRFY, EXPN, and RCPT TO commands for valid and invalid users from which
    we can determine valid users on SMTP server. Attackers can directly interact with SMTP via the telnet prompt
    and collect list of valid users on the SMTP server.

Which of the following protocols is the technology for both gateway-to-gateway (LAN-to-LAN)
 and host to gateway (remote access) enterprise VPN solutions?


  IPSec : True

  NetBios :

  SMTP :

  SNMP :

  Explanation:
IPsec is the most commonly implemented technology for both  :
      - gateway-to-gateway (LAN-to-LAN)
      - host-to-gateway (remote access)
  enterprise VPN solutions.
IPsec provides data security by employing various components such as :
    - ESP (encapsulation security payload),
    - AH (authentication header), and
    - IKE (Internet key exchange) to secure communication between VPN end-points.
 Most Ipsec-based VPNs use ISAKMP (Internet security association key management protocol), a part of IKE to :
      - establish,
      - negotiate,
