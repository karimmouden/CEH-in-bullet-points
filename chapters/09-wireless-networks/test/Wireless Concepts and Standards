                          with
                  a pseudo random noise spreading code.

Which of the following types of antennas is useful for transmitting
      weak radio signals
          over very long distances – on the order of 10 miles?


Uni-directional

Bi-directional

Omnidirectional

Parabolic grid : TRUE

A parabolic grid antenna uses the same principle as that of
          a satellite dish,
          but it does not have a solid backing.

It consists of a semidish that is
    in the form of a
        grid made of aluminum wire.

These parabolic grid antennas can achieve
      very long-distance Wi-Fi transmissions
          by using a highly focused radio beam.

This type of antenna is useful for
        transmitting weak radio signals
            over very long distances – on the order of 10 miles.

This enables attackers to get better signal quality,
    resulting in
        more data on which to eavesdrop,
        more bandwidth to abuse, and higher power output that is essential
            in layer 1 denial of service (DoS) and
                      man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
The design of this antenna
      saves weight & space,
      can pick up Wi-Fi signals that are
              either horizontally
                  or vertically
              polarized.

Which type of antenna is used in wireless communication?


Parabolic

Uni-directional

Omnidirectional : TRUE

  Omnidirectional antennas radiate electromagnetic energy in all directions.
  They usually uniformly radiate strong waves in two dimensions,
  but not as strong in the third.
  A good example of an omnidirectional antenna is one used by
      radio stations.
  These antennas are effective for radio signal transmission
      because the receiver may not be stationary.
  Therefore, a radio can receive a signal
      regardless of where it is.

Bi-directional

              wireless connectivity to local computers, and computers on
                different networks can also be interconnected.
        All hardware APs have the capability to interconnect with
              other hardware APs.
        However, interconnecting LANs over wireless connections is
              a complex task.

    Access point (AP) is used to connect wireless devices to a wireless/wired network.
    It allows wireless communication devices to connect to a
        wireless network through
              wireless standards such as
                  - Bluetooth
                  - Wi-Fi.

In which of the following processes
    do the station & access point use
        the same WEP key to provide authentication,
 which means that this key should be
        enabled and configured manually on
            both the access point and the client?


WEP encryption

Open-system authentication process

WPA encryption

Shared key authentication process : True

In a shared key authentication process, each wireless station receives a
      shared secret key over a secure channel that is distinct from
                the 802.11 wireless network communication channels.
The following steps illustrate the establishment of connection
        in the shared key authentication process:

?	The station sends an authentication frame to the AP.

?	The AP sends a challenge text to the station.

?	The station encrypts the challenge text by making use of
          its configured 64- or 128-bit key,
      and it sends the encrypted text to the AP.

?	The AP uses its configured WEP key to
        decrypt  encrypted text.
  The AP compares the decrypted text with
        the original challenge text.
  If the decrypted text matches
        the original challenge text,
  the AP authenticates the station.

?	The station connects to the network.

Which of the following is considered as a token to identify
      a 802.11 (Wi-Fi) network

The SSID is a token to identify an 802.11 (Wi-Fi) network; by default,

    Part of the frame header sent over a wireless local area network (WLAN).

Acts as a single shared identifier between the
    AP & clients.
If the SSID of the network is changed,
  reconfiguration of the SSID on every host is required,
    as every user of the network
        configures the SSID into their system.

Which of the following is considered as the method of transmitting radio signals by
    rapidly switching a carrier
        among many frequency channels?


Orthogonal Frequency-division Multiplexing (OFDM):

    OFDM is a method of digital modulation of data in which a signal,
          at a chosen frequency, is split into
                multiple carrier frequencies that are
                    orthogonal (occurring at right angles) to each other.
          - maps information on the changes in the
               - carrier phase,
               - frequency,
            or - amplitude,
          or a combination of these,
          - Shares bandwidth with other independent channels.
