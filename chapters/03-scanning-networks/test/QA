A technician is resolving an issue where a computer is unable to connect
to the Internet using a wireless access point.
The computer can transfer files locally to other machines,
but cannot successfully reach the Internet.
When the technician examines the IP address and default gateway,
 they are both on the 192.168.1.0/24. Which of the following has occurred?


    The computer is not using a private IP address.
    The gateway and the computer are not on the same network.
    The gateway is not routing to a public IP address. : True
    The computer is using an invalid IP address.

Explanation:
If the gateway is not routing to a public IP address, then there is no way
of getting to the Internet.
A default gateway is an IP router that is used to send information to a computer
 in another network.
Computers can send data to another network through the default gateway.

Which of the following is a routing protocol that allows the host
to
          discover the IP addresses

              of ACTIVE ROUTERS

                  on their subnet

by listening to router advertisement and soliciting messages on their network?


Explanation:

IRDP (True)

       ICMP Router Discovery Protocol (IRDP)

      Routing protocol

      Allows a host to
                discover the IP addresses of ACTIVE ROUTERS on its subnet

                    by listening to

                          - router advertisement msg
                          &
                          - solicitation messages

                    on its network.

      The attacker can add
            default route entries on a system remotely
      by spoofing router advertisement messages.

      Since IRDP does not require any authentication,
      the target host will prefer the default route defined by the attacker
      to the default route provided by the DHCP server.
      The attacker accomplishes this by setting :
              - Preference level
          and - Lifetime of the route at high values
      to ensure that the target hosts will choose it as the preferred route.

ARP
      Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a

                          stateless TCP/IP protocol
      that maps
          IP network addresses
      to
          hardware addresses used by a data link protocol.

      Using this protocol, a user can easily
              obtain the MAC address
                  of any device on a network.


///////
DHCP
      Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a

                  client/server protocol

      DHCP Server provides :

          - an IP address to an IP host.
          - configuration  information such as
                  - default gateway
                  - subnet mask.

      When a DHCP Client device boots up,

            it participates in traffic broadcasting.

DNS
      Domain Name System (DNS)

      Protocol

      Translates
            a domain name (e.g., www.eccouncil.org)
                    into
            an IP address (e.g., 208.66.172.56).

      The protocol uses DNS TABLES that

            contain the domain name and its equivalent

      IP address stored in a

                Distributed Large Database.

A hacker is attempting to see which protocols are supported by target machines
 or network. Which NMAP switch would the hacker use?


-sO (IP protocol scan) : TRUE

    IP protocol scan allows you to

      determine which IP protocols

            (TCP, ICMP, IGMP, etc.)

      are supported by target machines.

    This isn't technically a port scan, since  :

          it cycles

              through IP protocol numbers

              rather than TCP or UDP port numbers.

-sT (TCP connect scan)

    TCP connect scan is the default TCP scan type when SYN scan is not an option.

    This is the case when a user

              does not have "raw packet privileges".

    Instead of writing raw packets (as most other scan types do),

              Nmap asks the underlying OS to

                   establish a connection with

                          target machine & port

                   by issuing the

                        "CONNECT SYSTEM CALL".

-sS (TCP SYN scan)
    SYN scan is the default scan option used for scanning

              thousands of ports per second

    on a fast network not hampered by restrictive firewalls.

-sU (UDP scans)

    UDP scan works by sending a UDP packet to

            every targeted port.

If a tester is attempting

    to PING a target that exists

            but receives

                - no response

            or

                - a response that states the destination is "unreachable",

=>      ICMP may be disabled
                &
        network may be using TCP.

Which other option could the tester use to get a response from a host using TCP?

      Traceroute
      Broadcast ping
      TCP ping

      Hping : Hping2/Hping3 is : - a command-line-oriented network scanning
                                 - a packet crafting tool for the TCP/IP
                                    protocol that :
                                        - sends ICMP echo requests
                                        - supports TCP, UDP, ICMP, and raw-IP
                                            protocols.
                                        - performs :
                                              - network security auditing,
                                              - firewall testing,
                                              - manual path MTU discovery,
                                              - advanced traceroute,
                                              - remote OS fingerprinting,
                                              - remote uptime guessing,
                                              - TCP/IP stacks auditing,
                                              and other functions.

In the above scenario, host does not respond to a ping request.

Here, tester need to

    use Hping tools

      & perform ACK scan
                    to get the response
                              from a host using TCP.

Hping can be configured to perform an ACK scan by specifying
      the argument -A in the command line.

Here, you are setting

          ACK flag in the probe packets
          and performing the scan.

You perform this scan when a host does not respond to a ping request.

By issuing this command, Hping checks

                if a host is alive on a network.

If it finds a

        - live host
        &
        - open port

              =>  it returns an RST response.

        The host is likely a Windows machine.
        The host is likely a printer :

              protocols TCP and UDP uses port 515
                              to interact with the printer.
              As port 515 is open,
                              probably the host is a printer.?
        The host is likely a Linux machine.
        The host is likely a router.

What results will the following command yield?

nmap -sS -O -p 123-153 192.168.100.3

    A stealth scan, opening port 123 and 153.


    A stealth scan, determine operating system, and scanning ports 123 to 153. TRUE:

                      -sS specifies stealth scan,
                      -O attempts to perform OS fingerprinting to identify
                            the operating system,
                      -p specifies port range to scan.

         Hence,
              "stealth scan   + determine operating system,
                              + scanning ports 123 to 153”
                                        is the correct answer.

    A stealth scan, checking open ports 123 to 153.
    A stealth scan, checking all open ports excluding ports 123 to 153.

            Fingerprinting to identify which operating systems are running on the network.

            Traceroute to control the path of the packets sent during the scan.


The tester needs to implement

        timing options

in Nmap which allows the tester to

        set the given amount of time

                  between each probe it sends to a given host.

TIMING OPTION is used to evade

        threshold-based IDS & IPS

Some of the timing options are as follows:

?        --delay <time> (Delay between probes)

?        --rate <rate> (Send probes at a given rate)

?        -d <time>, --delay <time> (Specify line delay)

?        -i <time>, --idle-timeout <time> (Specify idle timeout)

?        -w <time>, --wait <time> (Specify connect timeout)

You are performing a port scan with Nmap.

You are in hurry and conducting the scans at the

      fastest possible speed.

However, you don’t want to

      sacrifice reliability for speed.

If stealth is not an issue,

  what type of scan should you run to get very
                                        RELIABLE results?

      Stealth scan
      Fragmented packet scan
      XMAS scan
      Connect scan : True

      Explanation:

            "TCP Connect/Full Open Scan" is one of the

                        MOST RELIABLE forms

                              of TCP scanning.

            In TCP Connect scanning,

                  the OS’s
                      "TCP connect() SYSTEM CALL"

                        tries to open a

                            connection to every interesting port

                                                on the target machine.

            => Fastest scanning method supported by Nmap.

            Making a separate connect() call

                for every targeted port in a linear fashion

                    would take a long time over a slow connection.

            You can accelerate the scan by

                    using many sockets in parallel.

            Using non-blocking, I/O allows you to set a

                              low time-out period
                          and
                              watch all the sockets simultaneously.

            In the above scenario, user needs a reliable result in less time.

            User needs to run connect scan to get the desired result.

Which NMAP command combination would let a tester scan

      every TCP port from a
          class C network

that is blocking ICMP with fingerprinting and service detection?


            NMAP -PN -O -sS -p 1-1024 192.168.0/8
            NMAP -PN -A -O -sS 192.168.2.0/24 : TRUE
            NMAP -P0 -A -sT -p0-65535 192.168.0/16
            NMAP -P0 -A -O -p1-65535 192.168.0/24

Explanation:

-Pn  : " No Ping "

        Assume  host is up,
            => skip  host discovery phase,


    whereas

-P0  : "IP Protocol Ping"

        sends IP packets with

                specified PROTOCOL NUMBER

                                  set in  IP HEADER.

-A :
    This options makes Nmap  :

          - make an EFFORT to IDENTIFY   :

                  - OS,
                  - services,
                  - versions.

          - traceroute & applies :
                  - NSE scripts to detect additional information.



-O :  OS fingerprinting .

Used alongside the

-v  : VERBOSITY option,

      gain information about  :

            - remote OS
            &
            - OS's TCP sequence number generation
              (useful for planning idle scans).

-sS Perform a TCP SYN connect scan.
    Nmap will send a TCP SYN packet just like any normal application would do.
    If port open, application must reply with SYN/ACK;
    however, to prevent half-open connections Nmap will send an RST to tear
    down the connection again.

-sT is an Nmap TCP connect scan
    it is the default TCP scan type when SYN scan is not an option.
        Since, Class C network starts its IP address from 192.0.0.0.
            So,

              “NMAP -PN -A -O -sS 192.168.2.0/24”

                    is the correct answer.

Which of the following Hping3 command is used to perform ACK scan?


hping3 -1 <IP Address> –p 80 : ICMP ping
hping3 –A <IP Address> –p 80 : ACK scan on port 80  : TRUE
hping3 -2 <IP Address> –p 80 : UDP scan on port 80
hping3 -8 50-60 –S <IP Address> –V : SYN scan on port 50-60
