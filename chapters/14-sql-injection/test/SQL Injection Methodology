A tester has been hired to do a web application security test.

The tester notices that the
          site is dynamic =>  must make use of a back-end database.

In order for the tester to see if an SQL injection is possible, what is the first character that the tester should use to attempt breaking a valid SQL request?


          Single quote : TRUE

          Semicolon

          Double quote

          Exclamation mark

During a penetration test, a tester finds a target that is running

              MS SQL 2000 with default credentials.

The tester assumes that the service is running with a

                  local system account.

How can this weakness be exploited to access the system?


                              Using the Metasploit psexec module
                                                    setting the SA/admin credential

                              Invoking the stored procedure xp_cmdshell
                                                  to spawn a Windows command shell   : TRUE

                              Invoking the stored procedure cmd_shell
                                                  to spawn a Windows command shell

                              Invoking the stored procedure xp_shell
                                                  to spawn a Windows command shell

Shea is a licensed penetration tester.
She is working with a client to test their new e-commerce website for SQL injection.
After signing the NDA and agreeing on the rules of engagement (RoE),

    she starts by examining and listing all the input fields on the website.

    She tries to insert a string value in the CVV2 textbox,
            where a three-digit number is expected,
                    and she ends up with the below error message.

"Microsoft ole db provider for ODBC Drivers error '80040e07'  [Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver]
[SQL Server] Syntax ERROR converting VARCHAR value 'test' to a column of data type int.
visa/credit.aspx   line 17"


Identify in which stage of the SQL injection methodology is Shea right now.


        Launch SQL injection attacks

        Information gathering and SQL injection vulnerability detection : TRUE

        Perform blind SQL injection

        Exploit second-order SQL injection

Talisa is inspecting the website Movie Scope for SQL injection attacks.

She is using an open-source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws and the taking over of database servers.

The tool is called sqlmap.

Talisa was able to find and exploit an SQL injection vulnerability in the
    user ID parameter on the website.

Now she has full control over the DBMS.

However, she had to prove to the website owner that she was able to execute SQL commands on the DB server and successfully retrieve answers from the DB prior to getting paid.

From the screenshot below, identify the SQL command that Talisa used in order to retrieve the DBMS version.




          SELECT @@VERSION        : TRUE

          GET @@VERSION

          SELECT * FROM VERSION

          SELECT @VERSION

William has been hired by the ITSec, Inc. to perform web application security testing.

He was asked to perform
        black box penetration testing
to test the security of the company’s web applications.

No information is provided to William about the company’s network and infrastructure.

William notices that the
          company website is dynamic and must make use of a backend database.

He wants to see if an SQL injection would be possible.

As part of the testing, he tries to

        catch instances where
              the user input is used as
                    part of an SQL identifier
                        without any input sanitization.

Which of the following characters should William use as the input data to catch the above instances?


            Double quote          :  TRUE

            Right square bracket

            Semicolon

            Single quote            : TRUE

  Explanation:

  Single & double quotes:

      In black box penetration testing, single and double quotes are used as the input data to catch instances where the user input is not sanitized.

  Semicolon:

      In black box penetration testing, a semicolon is used to group two or more SQL statements in the same line.

A tester has been hired to perform
            source code review of a web application to
                    detect SQL injection vulnerabilities.

As part of the testing process, he needs to
          get all the information about the project from the development team.

During the discussion with the development team,
      he comes to know that the project is in the initial stage of the development cycle.

As per the above scenario, which of the following processes
                                      does the tester need to follow
                                              in order to save the company’s time and money?


            The tester needs to perform static code analysis as it covers the executable file of the code

            The tester needs to perform static code analysis as it covers the structural and statement coverage testing      : TRUE

            The tester needs to perform dynamic code analysis as it finds and fixes the defects

            The tester needs to perform dynamic code analysis as it uncovers bugs in the software system


Explanation:

Option A: The main objective of static code analysis is to


          improve the quality of software products by

                      finding errors in the early stages of the development cycle.

          In static testing, code is not executed.
          It involves manual or automated reviews of the documents.
          This review is done during the initial phase of the testing to catch defects early in SDLC.
          It assesses the code and documentation and covers the structural and statement coverage testing.

Option B: Static code analysis is performed in early stages of the development cycle. In static testing, code is not executed, so it does not cover the testing of an executable file of the code.

Option C: Dynamic code analysis checks for functional behavior of the software system, memory/CPU usage, and overall performance of the system. In dynamic testing, code is executed to uncover bugs in the software system. This testing is not performed in the early stages of the development cycle.

Option D: Dynamic code analysis finds and fixes the defects, but the cost of finding and fixing defects is high.
