What technique is used to perform a Connection Stream Parameter Pollution (CSPP) attack?


            Inserting malicious Javascript code into input parameters

            Setting a user's session identifier (SID) to an explicit known value

            Injecting parameters into a connection string using semicolons as a separator  : TRUE

            Adding multiple parameters with the same name in HTTP requests

Which of the following is a common Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) vulnerability?


                SQL injection

                XML denial of service issues : TRUE

                VPath injection

                Cross-site scripting

Explanation:

XML is a versatile data-encoding standard.

In XML security issues can be raised as parsing XML complex.

One common issue is a denial of service (DOS) against a web service.

A user can identify whether a DOS attack has occurred or not by an XML message.

If XML provides a very large payload of malicious external entities then DOS can occur.

Cross-site scripting, SQL injection, and VPath injection have nothing to do with SOA)vulnerability.

The security analyst for Danels Company arrives this morning to his office and verifies the primary home page of the company.

He notes that the page has the logo of the competition and writings that do not correspond to the true page. What kind of attack do the observed signals correspond to?


          Defacement   : TRUE

          DDoS

          Phishing

          Http Attack

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Which of the following attack is not selected as OWASP Top 10 Application Security Risks in the year 2017?


        XML External Entity (XXE) attacks

        Insecure Deserialization attacks

        DDoS attacks   : TRUE

        Injection attacks

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Which of the following involves injection of malicious code through a web application?


        SQL Injection

        Shell Injection

        Command Injection : TRUE

        LDAP Injection

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Which of the following attacks can take place due to flaws such as
        insecure cryptographic storage
        and
        information leakage?


        SQL injection

        Shell injection

        Command injection

        Sensitive data exposure : TRUE

An attacker exploits a web application by

    tampering with the

            form
            &
            parameter

     of the web application

    and he is successful in exploiting the web application and gaining access.

Which type of vulnerability did the attacker exploit?


        Security misconfiguration : TRUE

        Sensitive data exposure

        Broken access control

        SQL injection



Explanation:

Using misconfiguration vulnerabilities such as

      - unvalidated inputs,
      - parameter/form tampering,
      - improper error handling,
      - insufficient transport layer protection, and so on,

attackers  :
      gain unauthorized accesses to default accounts,
      read unused pages,
      read/write unprotected files and directories, and so on.

Security misconfiguration can occur

        at any level of an application stack,
              including the platform,
                            webserver,
                            application server,
                            framework, and
                            custom code.

If a threat detection software
  installed in any organization network

      either
            does not record the malicious event
      or
            ignores the important details about the event,

then what kind of vulnerability is it?


      Broken Access Control

      Security Misconfiguration

      Insufficient Logging and Monitoring : TRUE

      Sensitive Data Exposure

Explanation:

Web applications maintain logs
      to track usage patterns such as
              user login credentials
              admin login credentials.

Insufficient logging and monitoring
        detection software
            either does not record the malicious event
            or     ignores the important details about the event.

Attackers usually
          inject,
          delete,
      or  tamper with web application logs to
                      - engage in malicious activities
                      - hide their identities.

Any threat detection software with an insufficient logging and monitoring vulnerability makes the detection of malicious attempts of the attacker more difficult to identify and allows the attacker to perform malicious attacks like password brute force etc. to steal confidential passwords.

Which of the following attacks exploits vulnerabilities in dynamically generated webpages, which enables malicious attackers to inject client-side scripts into webpages viewed by other users?

Broken access control
