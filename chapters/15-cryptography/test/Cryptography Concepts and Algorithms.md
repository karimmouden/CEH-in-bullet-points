# Cryptography Concepts and Algorithms


## Some passwords are stored using specialized encryption algorithms known as hashes. Why is this an appropriate method?

### Passwords stored using hashes are nonreversible, making finding the password much more difficult.

Hashing is faster when compared to more traditional encryption algorithms.

It is impossible to crack hashed user passwords unless the key used to encrypt them is obtained.

If a user forgets the password, it can be easily retrieved using the hash key stored by administrators.



## After gaining access to the password hashes used to protect access to a web-based application, the knowledge of which cryptographic algorithms would be useful to gain access to the application?

### SHA1

Diffie-Helman

AES

RSA


## The fundamental difference between symmetric and asymmetric key cryptographic systems is that symmetric key cryptography uses__________________?


### The same key on each end of the transmission medium

Different keys on both ends of the transport medium

Bulk encryption for data transmission over fiber

Multiple keys for non-repudiation of bulk data



## Which cipher encrypts the plain text digit (bit or byte) one by one?


Block cipher

Modern cipher

Classical cipher

### Stream cipher


## Which of the following algorithms provides better protection against brute force attacks by using a 160-bit message digest?


MD5

### SHA-1

RC4

MD4



## What is the most secure way to mitigate the theft of corporate information from a laptop that was left in a hotel room?


### Encrypt the data on the hard drive.

Set a BIOS password.

Back up everything on the laptop and store the backup in a safe place.

Use a strong logon password to the operating system.


## Which of the following is an example of an asymmetric encryption implementation?


### PGP

MD5

3DES

SHA1


## Which of the following is a symmetric cryptographic algorithm?


### 3DES

DSA

RSA

PKI


## Advanced encryption standard is an algorithm used for which of the following?


Key recovery

## Bulk data encryption

Data integrity

Key discovery



## What is the primary drawback of using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm with a 256-bit key to share sensitive data?


Due to the key size, the time it will take to encrypt and decrypt the message hinders efficient communication.

## It is a symmetric key algorithm, meaning each recipient must receive the key through a different channel than the message.

It has been proven to be a weak cipher; therefore, should not be trusted to protect sensitive data.

To get messaging programs to function with this algorithm requires complex configurations.
